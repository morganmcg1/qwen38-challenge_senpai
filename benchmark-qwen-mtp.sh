#
# Every gate and every measurement below is an EXISTING harness entrypoint; this
# script only wires them together in the right order. In order:
#
#   0. transformed weights     `./benchmark.sh --transform-only` when weights/ is
#                              missing or stale, then a track gate on the tree it
#                              produced (Qwen family + pinned geometry). setup.sh
#                              provisions the reference checkpoint and never
#                              transforms it, so the manifest's own sequence --
#                              ./setup.sh && ./setup-qwen-mtp.sh, then this
#                              script -- reaches this point with an empty
#                              weights/ on every fresh machine. It used to abort
#                              here and name a full local benchmark as the
#                              manual step; now it runs the transform step alone.
#                              This happens BEFORE this script takes its run
#                              lock, and --transform-only takes benchmark.sh's
#                              lock in its own process, so the two never contend.
#   1. public drift tripwire   `mlxfast-swift correctness` against the checked-in
#                              public fixture -- the same subcommand and the same
#                              fixture the base local loop uses.
#   2. GPU cool gate           `./benchmark.sh --local-cool-gate-only`, the base
#                              local loop's own 40C gate, before EACH
#                              model-resident leg.
#   3. TRUE serial control     `mlxfast-swift mtp-timed --mtp-depth 0`  (denominator)
#   4. native-MTP decode       `mlxfast-swift mtp-timed`            (numerator)
#
# The reference rows both measured legs decode come from `mlxfast-swift
# mtp-verify --generate`, the producer of the shape they consume.
#
# WHAT THIS SCORE IS NOT. It is DIRECTIONAL and can never be a ranked score:
#   * the reference rows are produced by the CANDIDATE's own build, not by the
#     pinned baseline, so it checks MTP/serial parity and speed direction -- not
#     target fidelity;
#   * the ranked run times ALL 8 hidden pool prompts, normalises each against
#     that prompt's own pinned no-op reference and publishes the MEDIAN of the 8
#     -- none of which this local loop can reproduce (it has one prompt, no
#     pinned references and no median to take);
#   * .github/workflows/qwen-mtp-ranked-benchmark.yml measures against
#     organizer-pinned hidden goldens on the ranked box and is the only authority
#     for both fidelity and score.
#
# ONE MODEL-HOLDING RUN AT A TIME. A native-MTP residency is the Qwen 3.6 27B
# target plus the ~247 MB MTP head. This script reuses BOTH halves of
# benchmark.sh's memory guard -- the per-user run lock (which excludes a
# concurrent local run in either direction) and the resident-model scan (which
# catches what no lock can: an ORPHANED model-holding worker from a run that died
# without releasing) -- by EXTRACTING benchmark.sh's own definitions rather than
# copying them, so the lock path and the process pattern cannot drift into two
# implementations that both "hold a lock" and exclude nothing.

Usage: ./benchmark-qwen-mtp.sh [--local-iterate|--local-submit]

Runs the native-MTP decode path against a candidate-local serial K=1 control and
writes a directional Yukon score payload to MLXFAST_SCORE_PATH
(default: score.json).

Prerequisites (all reused, never rebuilt here):
  ./setup.sh                     builds mlxfast-swift + the MLX metallib and
                                 provisions the pinned Qwen 3.8 27B checkpoint
  ./setup-qwen-mtp.sh            provisions the pinned MTP head

The transformed weights/ tree is NOT a prerequisite: when it is missing or
stale this script runs ./benchmark.sh --transform-only itself (the transform
step only -- no measurement) and then re-checks it.

Environment:
  MLXFAST_SCORE_PATH                      score payload path (default score.json)
  MLXFAST_WEIGHTS_PATH                    transformed weights tree (default weights)
  MLXFAST_SWIFT_BIN                       trusted CLI (default .build/release/mlxfast-swift)
  MLXFAST_QWEN_MTP_DEPTH                  speculative depth, 2..4 (default 2,
                                          the ranked workflow's value)
  MLXFAST_QWEN_MTP_LOCAL_ITERATE_TOKENS   decode tokens for --local-iterate (default 64)
  MLXFAST_QWEN_MTP_LOCAL_SUBMIT_TOKENS    decode tokens for --local-submit (default 128)
  MLXFAST_QWEN_MTP_LOCAL_WORK_DIR         scratch root (default .mlxfast-local-qwen-mtp,
                                          removed on exit)
  MLXFAST_QWEN_MTP_HEAD_DIR               MTP head directory (default: setup-qwen-mtp.sh's cache)
  MLXFAST_GPU_TEMP_CMD                    benchmark.sh's documented cool-gate seam
