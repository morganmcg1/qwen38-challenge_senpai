# Qwen 3.8 Senpai Campaign Ledger

This is the compact, versioned index for advisor handoffs. Update it with every
terminal experiment and official receipt. Keep large local score artifacts out
of Git; link only reproducible commands, commits, and concise evidence.

Machine-readable frontier pins live in
[`frontier-state.json`](frontier-state.json). If this ledger and that file
disagree, stop and repair both before assigning or submitting work.

## Current frontier

Observed from Yukon and the organizer remote at `2026-08-16T12:05:47Z`.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Organizer source | `Layr-Labs/qwen-3.8-mtp-challenge` |
| Organizer synced commit | `7351e62674bc600f0ca148d3a1b0604716a09db6` |
| Best promoted submission | `e6c5ef35-0d86-4cec-a5d6-366e2e59cdcd` |
| Promoted source ref | `7351e62674bc600f0ca148d3a1b0604716a09db6` |
| Official score | `2.9042110287045` |
| Campaign `BASE_SHA` | Fetch `origin/main`, then run `git rev-parse origin/main`; the Git ref is authoritative because a file cannot contain the hash of its own commit |
| Submitted solver snapshot | `7351e62674bc600f0ca148d3a1b0604716a09db6` |

The promoted receipt above is the public Yukon frontier used to bootstrap this
campaign; it is not claimed as a Senpai-authored result.

Campaign commit `ce159755215b60c8f582f3b4402ddf483083d990`
imports that exact promoted submitted surface. The source is based on trusted
organizer parent `26ae2bf6326de93e7f1b1b0aaf94a7667aca797b`;
relative to the previous `df404e08fee2ef8681f5bf2d68fe841969788eaf`
snapshot, its submitted delta is exactly `Qwen36MTPBlockSession.swift` and
`Qwen35.swift` (`+54/-14`). Every other editable path, including the declared
proposal-head manifest, is identical. Trusted-base ancestry was reviewed
separately and was not imported as solver code.

## Same-host baselines

| Base SHA | Host / memory profile | Toolchain | Head provenance | Command | Key metrics | Evidence location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `7351e62674bc600f0ca148d3a1b0604716a09db6` | AWS Birch/Alphonse; Apple M4 Pro, 48 GB; automatic low-memory profile | macOS 26.5.2; Xcode 26.6; Swift 6.3.3 | pinned head SHA-256 `c3f8a09b3c2ff1a9b40c2c1a5f71236e2e57be31f861270c071e7ba909e18e64` | `MLXFAST_QWEN_MTP_LOCAL_WORK_DIR="$PWD/.mlxfast-local-qwen-mtp" yukon run` | pass; directional `1.4708805115725638`; exact `64/64`; serial `0.1292338595` s/token; MTP `0.0878615621` s/token; effective draft `5.4`; acceptance `1.0`; divergences `0` | ignored `score.aws-birch-alphonse.7351e626.baseline.json` (SHA-256 `0f166cdfcf0b3e1f33a438de5012c9e865c8c33ed1b7a20cc881a859eadc3b83`) and `local-docs/baselines/aws-birch-alphonse-7351e626/` |

That baseline ran on the detached promoted source. Its complete submitted
surface is identical to campaign import commit `ce159755`.

## Novelty index

Use one row per causal mechanism, not per branch. `Reopen when` must name new
evidence or a changed condition; “try again” is not enough.

| Mechanism | Scored path / cost center | Hypothesis | Best evidence | Disposition | Reopen when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Exact-fill first K/V-cache retention | `KVCacheSimple.update`; charged 512-token seed in 16 full-attention layers | Retaining incoming K/V when an empty cache receives an exact multiple of its 256-row step removes zero-fill and full-slice replacement without changing shape, offset, or layout | Stock code allocates exact-size zero arrays and then overwrites every element; the transfer map specifies boundary and rollback tests | untested; ready | Close after exact 512+1...9, snapshot/rollback, layout, and matched seed timing; reopen only after cache/step changes or fresh profiling |
| Packed GDN prework for S=1...2 | 48 GDN layers on serial, adaptive-skip, and narrow verify calls | A small-width variant that explicitly sources required old conv-state rows can extend the promoted S=3...9 packed mixer | The current mixer passed exhaustive campaign checks; source inspection locates the S=2 boundary at old conv-state ownership | untested; medium risk | Proceed only with explicit old-state construction; stop on any cache/output mismatch or less than roughly 0.25 ms named-call saving |
| Corrected packed GDN beta | Remaining `sigmoid(b)` launch/intermediate on promoted S=3...9 mixer path | Produce beta inside the packed kernel with an exact correction for finite BF16 input `0xC0DB` | Prior exhaustive BF16 comparison found one 1-ulp exception; the remaining launch is small but repeated | untested; exactness constrained | Require all 65,536 BF16 encodings, including NaN/Inf, plus exact recurrence/cache proof; close if correction cost has no end-to-end payoff |
| Compiled fused-SwiGLU causal isolation | `Qwen35FusedMLP`, S<=9 target/head path | The compiled slice-SiLU-product expression removes one launch/intermediate and may contribute independently | Present in promoted `7351e626`; the four-hunk composite improved `2.876429` to `2.904211`, but no component was isolated | promoted in composite; individual sign unresolved | Run a matched `7351e626` on/off ablation before extending or composing it; require movement outside matched noise or direct structural evidence |
| Pair GQA query heads per K/V read | Short-query SDPA in 16 full-attention layers; six query heads share each KV head | Processing two Q heads per K/V read can reduce duplicated traffic while retaining independent per-head accumulation order | Qwen geometry exposes a 6:1 reuse seam; broader grouped-SDPA work has hit M5 register/pipeline limits | unresolved; resource-gated | Reopen only when a D256 pair-head kernel compiles on M5 with acceptable registers/occupancy and exact per-head outputs |

## Experiment receipts

| Date | Branch / candidate | Mechanism | Base SHA | Local result | Official result | Result record |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-08-16 | clean Yukon source / `7351e626` | untouched promoted-tree baseline | `7351e62674bc600f0ca148d3a1b0604716a09db6` | pass; M4-local directional score `1.4708805115725638`; public tripwire passed; exact `64/64` | not submitted; local result is non-rankable | Same-host baseline row above; submitted surface now matches campaign import `ce159755` |
| 2026-08-16 | `codex/sync-organizer-frontier-20260816` / `ce159755` | exact promoted editable-snapshot import | `eb2dc26caf48ac126e0f51df7db5130414ff1d94` | release build, overlay, budget, twin, and trusted-parity checks passed; full `swift test` reached product compilation but was blocked by unchanged organizer test-source type error at `QwenMTPVerbTests.swift:755` | adopted public promoted `e6c5ef35` at `2.9042110287045`; not a Senpai-authored submission | Source delta is exactly two editable Swift files (`+54/-14`); campaign records and novelty queue refreshed separately |

## Update checklist

1. Confirm the exact base, candidate, organizer, and promoted source SHAs.
2. Add or revise one novelty row with the mechanism's disposition.
3. Add the result receipt and the public submission receipt, if any.
4. Update same-host baseline rows whenever the base, host, head, or toolchain
   changes.
5. Keep `frontier-state.json` synchronized whenever organizer or promoted
   frontier pins change.
