// Qwen 3.6 27B native-MTP speculative decode — the worker-side hot path for the
// `qwen3.8-27b-mtp-v1` track.
//
// PROVENANCE. The accept/verify/rollback loop below is a migration of the MTP
// session's exploratory driver (`Sources/Qwen36MTPDriver/main.swift`), which is
// itself a faithful Swift port of MTPLX's `generate_mtpa`
// (MTPLX/mtplx/generation.py L10176-10420). That driver was validated 12/12
// exact-greedy to 512 tokens against the serial trajectory on M5, across all EOS
// branches, and corroborated against MTPLX. Nothing about the ALGORITHM changed
// in the migration; what changed is where it runs (the sandboxed runtime worker
// instead of a standalone target), how the head arrives (a separately pinned
// tree merged at load instead of a merged checkpoint) and that every round now
// declares an auditable row ledger to the trusted parent.
//
// Per round:
//   1. emit the pending primary; clamp the depth to the remaining token budget
//   2. draft `cycleDepth` tokens from the head (ONE fresh head cache per round,
//      shared across the sub-steps; each sub-step chains the head's own
//      post-`mtp.norm` hidden — MTPLX `mtp_cache_policy` default "persistent")
//   3. snapshot the non-trimmable (GDN/recurrent) state, then verify
//      `[primary] + drafts` in ONE batched target forward
//   4. accept the longest common prefix: row i of the verify output is the
//      target's greedy continuation of verify input i, i.e. the truth for draft i
//   5. full acceptance -> keep the verify state; the next primary is the argmax
//      of the bonus row D. Otherwise -> roll the WHOLE verify window back (trim
//      all 1+D positions from the trimmable caches AND restore the recurrent
//      snapshot) and re-forward the committed block `[primary] + acceptedDrafts`;
//      its last row is the next primary and its last hidden feeds the next draft.
//
// WHY NOT THE VENDORED DFLASH ROLLBACK. `RecurrentRollbackCache` rolls the GDN
// state forward by replaying an innovation tape the GDN forward is supposed to
// hand it via `recordTape()`. Nothing in the vendored code ever calls
// `recordTape`, so the tape is always nil and the cache silently degenerates to a
// pre-verify snapshot restore while the KV caches are trimmed to
// prefix+1+accepted — the 48 recurrent layers and the 16 attention layers desync
// on every partial acceptance. MTPLX's snapshot + rollback + re-forward needs no
// tape, which is why it is the baseline here. Grafting the tape into the Qwen35
// GDN forward is a documented LATER perf upgrade, deliberately not attempted.

/// One round's worth of committed tokens plus the row ledger the trusted parent
/// audits. Field names mirror the DFlash round result so the parent-side ledger
/// arithmetic and the box wrapper's Criterion E L3 checks are the same shape on
