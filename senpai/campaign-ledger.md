# Qwen 3.8 Senpai Campaign Ledger

This is the compact, versioned index for advisor handoffs. Update it with every
terminal experiment and official receipt. Keep large local score artifacts out
of Git; link only reproducible commands, commits, and concise evidence.

Machine-readable frontier pins live in
[`frontier-state.json`](frontier-state.json). If this ledger and that file
disagree, stop and repair both before assigning or submitting work.

## Current frontier

Observed from Yukon and the organizer remote at `2026-08-16T11:16:39Z`.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Organizer source | `Layr-Labs/qwen-3.8-mtp-challenge` |
| Organizer synced commit | `26ae2bf6326de93e7f1b1b0aaf94a7667aca797b` |
| Best promoted submission | `e6c5ef35-0d86-4cec-a5d6-366e2e59cdcd` |
| Promoted source ref | `7351e62674bc600f0ca148d3a1b0604716a09db6` |
| Official score | `2.9042110287045` |
| Campaign `BASE_SHA` | Fetch `origin/main`, then run `git rev-parse origin/main`; the Git ref is authoritative because a file cannot contain the hash of its own commit |
| Submitted solver snapshot | `df404e08fee2ef8681f5bf2d68fe841969788eaf` |

The promoted receipt above is the public Yukon frontier used to bootstrap this
campaign; it is not claimed as a Senpai-authored result.

## Same-host baselines

| Base SHA | Host / memory profile | Toolchain | Head provenance | Command | Key metrics | Evidence location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Official campaign submissions

| Submission ID | Candidate SHA | Base SHA | Model | Score / status | Public note | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _No Senpai campaign submissions yet._ | | | | | | |

## Novelty index

Use one row per causal mechanism, not per branch. `Reopen when` must name new
evidence or a changed condition; “try again” is not enough.

| Mechanism | Scored path / cost center | Hypothesis | Best evidence | Disposition | Reopen when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _Seed new mechanisms here before assignment._ | | | | untested | |

## Experiment receipts

| Date | Branch / candidate | Mechanism | Base SHA | Local result | Official result | Result record |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-08-16 | clean Yukon `main` / `7351e626` | untouched promoted-tree baseline | `7351e62674bc600f0ca148d3a1b0604716a09db6` | pass; M4-local directional score `1.4708805115725638`; public tripwire passed; exact `64/64` | not submitted; local result is non-rankable | Same-host baseline row above; repository stayed clean and scratch was removed |

## Update checklist

1. Confirm the exact base, candidate, organizer, and promoted source SHAs.
2. Add or revise one novelty row with the mechanism's disposition.
3. Add the result receipt and the public submission receipt, if any.
4. Update same-host baseline rows whenever the base, host, head, or toolchain
   changes.
5. Keep `frontier-state.json` synchronized whenever organizer or promoted
   frontier pins change.
